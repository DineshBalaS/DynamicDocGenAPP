You are an expert AWS Solutions Architect and DevOps engineer specializing in deploying containerized Python web applications. You are methodical, security-conscious, and provide clear, step-by-step instructions that explain both the "how" and the "why" for each action.

Your task is to create a complete, end-to-end deployment checklist for a Flask backend application on the AWS Free Tier.

Project Context
I have a complete Flask backend for a "PPTX Templater" web application that I have been developing locally. I now need to deploy it to AWS.

Application Architecture:

Backend: A Flask application that allows users to upload .pptx templates, saves them, and generates new presentations based on user data. The entry point is main:app.

Database: PostgreSQL. Locally, this runs in a separate Docker container. The application connects to it using a DATABASE_URL environment variable.

File Storage: Amazon S3. The application uses boto3 to upload, download, and delete files.

Production Server: The application is designed to run with Gunicorn in production.

Deployment Plan & Technology:

The backend will be deployed as a Docker container. I have already created a Dockerfile and a .dockerignore file.

I want to use AWS services that are part of the Free Tier where possible.

The target deployment services are AWS RDS for the PostgreSQL database, AWS ECR for the Docker image registry, and AWS App Runner to run the containerized backend.

Key Files & Configuration Details:


Dockerfile: Uses a python:3.11-slim base image , correctly sets a WORKDIR , leverages layer caching by copying Requirements.txt first and installing dependencies , copies the application code , exposes port 8000 , and uses CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000", "main:app"] to run the server.






requirements.txt: Contains Flask, gunicorn, boto3, psycopg2-binary, Flask-Cors, and other necessary packages.


.dockerignore: Correctly excludes venv/, __pycache__/, *.pyc, .env, and .vscode/ from the build context.

db_setup.py: A script that connects to the database using the DATABASE_URL environment variable and creates a templates table with a JSONB column for placeholders. It is designed to be run from the command line.

Security Context: For local development, I created an IAM User and used its access keys. I am not familiar with the best practice for giving AWS services permissions in production.

Your Task
Generate a comprehensive, step-by-step checklist for deploying this backend to AWS. The checklist must cover the following phases in a logical order, be tailored to the files provided, and be friendly for someone whose primary experience is with local development.

IAM & Security Setup (The Right Way):

Start by explaining the critical security difference between using a long-term IAM User (with access keys, good for local CLI) and a short-term, auto-rotating IAM Role (best practice for services).

Provide clear, step-by-step instructions on how to create an IAM Role that the AWS App Runner service can "assume" to gain secure, temporary permissions to read and write objects in the specific S3 bucket (wbmpptbucketmain).

Database Deployment (AWS RDS):

Guide me through creating a new PostgreSQL database instance on the AWS RDS Free Tier.

Include crucial steps like setting a master password and configuring the VPC security group to allow connections.

Container Registry (AWS ECR):

Explain how to create a new private ECR repository.

Provide the exact AWS CLI commands to:

Log the local Docker client into the ECR repository.

Build the Docker image using my existing Dockerfile.

Tag the newly built image correctly for the ECR repository.

Push the tagged image to ECR.

Backend Deployment (AWS App Runner):

Walk through the process of creating a new App Runner service.

This must include:

Selecting "Container registry" and pointing the service to the ECR image URI from the previous step.

A detailed section on configuring the Environment Variables in the App Runner console. List all the required variables (DATABASE_URL, S3_BUCKET_NAME, AWS_REGION, and a placeholder for the future FRONTEND_URL). Explain where to get the DATABASE_URL value from the RDS console.

How to configure the Security section to associate the App Runner service with the IAM Role created in the first step.

Post-Deployment Database Initialization:

Explain a secure method to connect to the new RDS database from my local machine to run the python db_setup.py script.

This should involve temporarily modifying the RDS instance's VPC Security Group to allow inbound traffic from my local IP address, running the script, and then removing that inbound rule for security.

Testing the Deployed API:

Provide clear instructions on how to take the public URL provided by App Runner (e.g., https://<service-id>.aws-region.awsapprunner.com) and use it in an API client like Postman or VS Code Thunder Client.

The test should be to make a GET request to the /api/templates endpoint to verify that the deployment was successful and that it can connect to the RDS database (it should return an empty array [] since the database is new).

Output Format:

Use Markdown for formatting.

Structure the output as a checklist with clear, numbered steps and sub-steps within logical sections (e.g., ## 1. IAM & Security Setup).

Use code blocks for shell commands.

The tone should be professional, instructional, and security-conscious. Explain the "why" behind important steps.

AWS Backend Hosting Checklist:-

‚úÖ Checklist: Create an IAM Role for App Runner
Navigate to IAM: In the AWS Console, go to the IAM service.

Create Policy: This policy will define what the role is allowed to do.

In the left-hand menu, click Policies, then Create policy.

Switch to the JSON tab and paste the following policy. This grants the minimum required permissions for your app to function with the S3 bucket.

JSON

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::wbmpptbucketmain/*"
        }
    ]
}
Click Next.

Give the policy a name, like AppRunnerS3AccessPolicy, and a description. Click Create policy.

Create Role (Updated Steps)
Navigate and Choose Role Type:

In the IAM console, click Roles, then Create role.

For "Trusted entity type," select Custom trust policy.

Edit the Trust Policy JSON:

In the JSON editor that appears, replace the default content with the following policy. This policy explicitly states that the App Runner service (build.apprunner.amazonaws.com) is the trusted principal that is allowed to assume this role.

JSON

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "tasks.apprunner.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
Click Next.

Add Permissions:

On the "Add permissions" screen, search for and check the box next to the AppRunnerS3AccessPolicy you created earlier.

Click Next.

Name and Create:

Give the role a name, like AppRunnerS3Role.

Review the details (the trusted entity should now list build.apprunner.amazonaws.com) and click Create role.

2. Database Deployment (AWS RDS) üêò
This creates your managed PostgreSQL database in the cloud.

‚úÖ Checklist: Create an RDS Free Tier Database
Navigate to RDS: In the AWS Console, go to the RDS service.

Create Database:

Click Create database.

Choose Standard create and select PostgreSQL as the engine.

Under "Templates," select Free tier. This will automatically limit options to what's free.

In the "Settings" section, set a DB instance identifier (e.g., pptx-templater-db).

Set a Master username (e.g., postgres).

Set a Master password. Use a strong, unique password and save it securely in a password manager.

Configure Connectivity:

In the "Connectivity" section, ensure "Public access" is set to No. Your App Runner service will communicate with the database over AWS's private network.

For "VPC security group," choose Create new. Give the new security group a name like pptx-db-sg.

Create Database:

Leave the remaining settings as their defaults and click Create database. Provisioning will take several minutes.

3. Container Registry (AWS ECR) üê≥
This is where you'll store your Docker image so App Runner can access it.

‚úÖ Checklist: Push Your Docker Image to ECR
Navigate to ECR: In the AWS Console, go to the Elastic Container Registry (ECR) service.

Create Repository:

Click Create repository.

Set the "Visibility" to Private.

Give it a "Repository name" (e.g., pptx-templater-backend).

Click Create repository.

‚úÖ Checklist: Add ECR Permissions to Your IAM User
Navigate to IAM: In the AWS Console, go to the IAM service.

Find Your User: In the left-hand menu, click on Users, then click on your user's name: pptx-templater-service-user.

Add Permissions:

You should be on the user's "Summary" page. Click the Add permissions button.

Select Attach policies directly.

In the search box under "Permissions policies," type ECR to filter the list.

Check the box next to the policy named AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryPowerUser. This policy provides the necessary permissions to get a login token and push images to ECR.

Click Next.

Confirm:

Review the change and click Add permissions.

Build, Tag, and Push Image:

Select the repository you just created and click the View push commands button. This will show you four commands tailored to your account and region.

Open your terminal in the Backend directory of your project (where your Dockerfile is).

Execute the four commands one by one. They will look similar to this:

Command 1: Authenticate Docker to ECR.

Bash

aws ecr get-login-password --region ap-south-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <your-aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com

Command 2: Build the Docker image. 



Bash

docker build -t pptx-templater-backend .
Command 3: Tag the image for ECR.

Bash

docker tag pptx-templater-backend:latest <your-aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/pptx-templater-backend:latest
Command 4: Push the image to ECR.

Bash

docker push <your-aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/pptx-templater-backend:latest
After the push completes, you can verify that the image is in your ECR repository in the AWS console.

4. Backend Deployment (AWS App Runner) üöÄ
This service will run your container and make it accessible on the web.

‚úÖ Checklist: Create the App Runner Service
Navigate to App Runner: In the AWS Console, go to the App Runner service.

Create Service:

Click Create service.

For "Source," select Container registry and Amazon ECR.

Click Browse and select your pptx-templater-backend repository and the latest tag. App Runner will automatically create an "ECR access role" for you; this is fine.

Click Next.

Configure Service:

Give your service a name (e.g., pptx-backend-service).

In the "Networking" section, for "VPC connector," select Create new. This is required for App Runner to communicate privately with your RDS database. Follow the prompts to create a connector in your default VPC.

‚úÖ Checklist: Configure the App Runner Service
Fill out the page using these settings.

Service settings
Service name: pptx-backend-service

Virtual CPU / Virtual memory: Choose 1 vCPU and 2 GB.

Why: This is the smallest (and cheapest) configuration. It's more than enough for your application and helps you stay within the AWS Free Tier for as long as possible.

Port: Change this from the default 8080 to 8000.

Why: This is a critical step. Your Dockerfile explicitly EXPOSE 8000 and tells Gunicorn to --bind "0.0.0.0:8000". The port configured in App Runner must match the port your application is listening on inside the container.


Start command: Leave this blank.


Why: Your Dockerfile already has a CMD instruction that runs Gunicorn. App Runner will use this command by default, which is exactly what you want.

Auto scaling
Configuration: Leave the "DefaultConfiguration" selected.

Minimum size: Leave this at 1 instance.

Maximum size: Leave this at 25 instances.

Why: The default auto-scaling is fine for starting out. The key benefit of a minimum size of 1 is that App Runner can scale down to a "paused" state when there is no traffic, which saves a significant amount of money.

Health check
Leave all settings as their defaults (TCP protocol, 5-second timeout, etc.).

Why: A simple TCP health check is perfect here. App Runner will periodically check if it can establish a connection to your container on port 8000. If it can, it knows your Gunicorn server is running and healthy.

Security
Instance role: From the dropdown, select the AppRunnerS3Role you created in the first major step.

Why: This is where you grant your running application the secure, temporary permissions it needs to access your S3 bucket.

AWS KMS key: Leave this as "Use an AWS-owned key".

Why: This provides encryption for your application's environment variables at no extra cost and requires no setup.

Networking
Incoming network traffic: Select Public endpoint.

Why: Your API needs to be accessible from the public internet so your React frontend (and you for testing) can send it requests.

Outgoing network traffic: Select Custom VPC.

Why: This is the second critical step. Your RDS database is in a private VPC and is not accessible from the public internet. By selecting this option and choosing the VPC connector you created, you are giving App Runner a "pathway" into that private network to communicate with your database.

Observability & Tags
You can leave these sections unchanged for now. X-Ray tracing and tags are useful features but are not required to get your service running.

‚úÖ Checklist: Creating the VPC Connector
VPC connector name:

Action: Give it a clear name, like pptx-vpc-connector.

Why: This is just a friendly name for you to identify it later.

VPC:

Action: Click the dropdown and select your default VPC. It will likely be the only one in the list.

Why: This is the "gated community" where your RDS database is located. You are telling the connector which private network to connect to.

Subnets:

Action: Select one or more of the private subnets from the list. The console will usually label them for you.

Why: Subnets are like different streets within your VPC. The connector needs to be attached to the same streets where your database might be located so it can find it.

Security groups üõ°Ô∏è:

Action: Select the default security group associated with your VPC.

Why: A security group acts as a firewall. This will be the firewall for the "bridge" itself. For the connection to work, the database's firewall must allow traffic from this bridge.

After filling this out, click Add. App Runner will take a minute to create the connector. Once it's created, you can select it from the "Custom VPC" dropdown in the main "Configure service" page.

Crucial Final Check
For the connection to be successful, you must ensure the database's security group allows traffic from the connector's security group.

Go to the VPC service in the AWS Console.

Click on Security Groups in the left menu.

Select your database's security group (the one you named pptx-db-sg).

Click the Inbound rules tab, then Edit inbound rules.

Make sure there is a rule that looks like this:

Type: PostgreSQL

Protocol: TCP

Port range: 5432

Source: Select the default security group (the same one you just assigned to the VPC connector).

Set Environment Variables:

In the "Security" section, for "Instance role," select the AppRunnerS3Role you created in Step 1.

In the "Configuration" section, under "Environment variables," add the following key-value pairs:

S3_BUCKET_NAME: wbmpptbucketmain

AWS_REGION: ap-south-1

FRONTEND_URL: http://localhost:3000 (Use this for now; you'll update it with your real frontend URL once it's deployed).

DATABASE_URL: Go to your RDS database console, click on your DB instance, and go to the "Connectivity & security" tab. Combine the Endpoint, Port, and your credentials into a single URL string. It must be in the format:
postgresql://<your-username>:<your-password>@<rds-endpoint>:<rds-port>/pptx_templater_db = "postgresql://postgres:WBM1234567PPT@pptx-templater-db.c32kiqaam6pl.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/pptx_templater_db"

Review and Create:

Click Next, review all the settings, and click Create & deploy. The first deployment will take several minutes.

5. Post-Deployment Database Initialization üõ†Ô∏è
Your app is running, but the database is empty. You need to run your db_setup.py script.

‚úÖ Checklist: Run the Setup Script
Find Your IP: Go to a site like https://www.whatismyip.com/ and copy your public IPv4 address.

Allow Local Connection to RDS:

Navigate to the RDS console and click on your database.

Go to the "Connectivity & security" tab and click on the active VPC security group (pptx-db-sg).

Select the "Inbound rules" tab and click Edit inbound rules.

Click Add rule.

Type: PostgreSQL

Source: Select My IP. It will auto-fill with your IP address.

Description: Temporary local access for db setup

Click Save rules.

Run the Script:

In your local terminal (in your Backend project folder), set the DATABASE_URL environment variable to the same one you used in App Runner.

On macOS/Linux: export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."

On Windows (PowerShell): $env:DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."

Run the script: python db_setup.py. You should see the message "Table 'templates' created successfully...".

‚ÄºÔ∏è REMOVE THE RULE: Go back to the security group inbound rules, find the rule you just added, and delete it. This is a critical security step to ensure your database is not exposed to the internet.

6. Testing the Deployed API üß™
Let's verify everything works.

‚úÖ Checklist: Test with Postman/Thunder Client
Get Your API URL: In the App Runner console, click on your service. The Default domain URL is your public API endpoint (e.g., https://<...>.awsapprunner.com).

Create a New Request:

Open Postman or VS Code Thunder Client.

Create a new GET request.

Paste your App Runner URL and append the endpoint path: https://<...>.awsapprunner.com/api/templates.

Send Request:

Click Send.

Expected Result: You should receive a 200 OK status code with an empty JSON array [] in the response body.

If you get this result, your deployment is successful! Your backend is live, secure, connected to S3 via its IAM Role, and connected to your RDS database.
